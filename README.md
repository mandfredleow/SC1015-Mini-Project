This mini project aims to show what we have learnt from the art and craft of Data Science - from Problem Formulation, Data Preparation, Exploratory Analysis,
Pattern Recognition to Machine Learning. The source of the data we used was gotten from SgCarMart, Singaporeâ€™s most popular car buying and selling website with over 
20,000 car listings. 

Our aim in this mini-project is to implement a Linear Regression Model, using a dataset to determine or form some sort of range of prices, what quantify as a 
reasonable price range for a used car should be.

We reference our web-scraper code from a github repository:
